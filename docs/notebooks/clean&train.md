# Data Cleaning and Training Model Documentation

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and prepares text data for machine learning model training. The dataset consists of support tickets with text documents and their corresponding topic groups.

## Dataset Information
- **File**: `all_tickets_processed_improved_v3.csv`
- **Dimensions**: 47,837 rows Ã— 2 columns
- **Columns**:
  - `Document`: Text content of support tickets
  - `Topic_group`: Categorical labels for ticket classification

## Data Structure
The dataset contains support tickets categorized into different topic groups:
- Hardware
- Access
- Miscellaneous
- ... (and other categories)

## Main Processes

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Setup
- **Imports essential libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk
- **Data loading**: Reads the CSV file containing processed support tickets
- **Visualization setup**: Configures plotting styles and color palettes

### 2. Data Exploration
- **Dataset overview**: Displays dimensions, column names, and first few rows
- **General information**: Shows data types and memory usage
- **Missing values analysis**: Confirms no null values in the dataset

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Category distribution**: Creates a horizontal bar chart showing the number of tickets per topic group
- **Visual features**:
  - Uses viridis color palette
  - Displays exact count values on bars
  - Professional formatting with clear labels and titles

### 4. Text Processing Preparation
The notebook imports natural language processing tools including:
- **NLTK stopwords**: For removing common words
- **String processing**: For text cleaning operations
- **Counter**: For frequency analysis of words

## Key Findings from Initial Analysis

### Data Quality
- **Complete dataset**: No missing values in either column
- **Balanced representation**: Multiple categories with varying numbers of tickets
- **Text data**: Documents contain processed support ticket text

### Category Distribution
The visualization reveals:
- Hardware and Access are major categories
- Miscellaneous represents a smaller portion
- Clear distribution patterns across different topic groups

## Purpose
This notebook serves as the foundation for:
1. **Text classification model training**
2. **Natural language processing pipeline**
3. **Support ticket categorization system**
4. **Customer service automation**

## Next Steps
Based on the imports and initial analysis, the notebook is likely to proceed with:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Model training for topic classification
- Performance evaluation and validation

The comprehensive data exploration ensures the dataset is properly understood before building machine learning models for automated ticket categorization.
